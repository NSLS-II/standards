Cookbook (Examples)
===================

Each recipe is a complete, runnable example.  See the individual project
documentation, linked in the menu at left, for detailed prose documentation and
API specification.

.. warning::

   Because these are complete runnable examples they will create new
   :class:`~bluesky.run_engine.RunEngine`,
   :class:`~databroker.Broker`, and temporary databases which will be
   populated with synthetic data.  Running these examples as-is on a
   production machine at a beamline is greatly discouraged.
